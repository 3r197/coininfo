# About LTC
### Purpose of coin
Litecoin was released in order to address several issues that founder Charlie Lee saw with Bitcoin's potential to act as a mainstream currency. This included a shorter block time of 2.5 minutes (compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes) and a greater cap of 84 million coins. Lastly, Litecoin implemented the Scrypt hashing algorithm instead of SHA-256 to remove the advantage GPUs have in mining.

### Incentives for holders
+ Use of Litecoin as a high-speed, low-transaction-cost currency. 
+ In May 2017, Litecoin adopted Segregated Witness several months ahead of Bitcoin and was the first transaction on Lightning Network the same month.
